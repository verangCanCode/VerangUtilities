# This is the prefix value, before any message is sent to the player. I.e. a message below will look like
# "VerangUtilities » Only players can use this command"
#
prefix: "&#8e4fb0&lVerang Utilities &8&l» &r"

#
# You may edit any values from the text below, without the need to add the prefix,
# and any color coding, as that will be done automatically by the plugin.
